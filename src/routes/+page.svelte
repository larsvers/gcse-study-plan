<h1>Stanley's GCSE Revision — Half Term 2026</h1>
<p><strong>18–21 February 2026</strong> · 4 sessions per day · 20 minutes each · real breaks · no heroics</p>

<h2>The Rules</h2>
<ol>
	<li>Each session is 20 minutes. When the timer goes, you stop.</li>
	<li>Breaks are real breaks. Stand up. Walk around. Get a drink. Phone stays in another room during study blocks.</li>
	<li>You don't need to know everything. You need to practise the right things.</li>
	<li>After each session, rate your confidence 1–3 on the <a href="/rate">Confidence page</a>.</li>
	<li>If a session goes well, great. If it doesn't, also great — you've found what needs work.</li>
</ol>

<h2>The Three Methods</h2>
<dl>
	<dt>⁂ The Blurt</dt>
	<dd>Read a page or watch a short video (10 min max). Close it. Write down EVERYTHING you remember. Then check what you missed. The gaps are gold.</dd>

	<dt>◉ Past Paper Drill</dt>
	<dd>Pick ONE exam question. Attempt it without notes. Time yourself. Then check the mark scheme. Highlight what you missed and WHY.</dd>

	<dt>⚙ The Feynman</dt>
	<dd>Learn something, then explain it to Lars as if he knows nothing about it. If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it yet.</dd>
